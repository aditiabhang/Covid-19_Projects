## Covid 19 Outbreak: Data Analysis & Data Visualization

I started out my Data Science learning by adding up fuel to my area of interest if having a focused career in Data Science.
This project is my initial learning journey project which helped me keep my foot on the paddle to accelerate in the direction of data analysis and data visualization. 

While emplementing this Covid 19 project, I got to learn many hands-on common but necessary data visualization libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and plotly.
I made use of the **COVID-19 data** from the [GitHub data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). 
Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL).

I was able to analyze the following questions with the help of bar graphs.
1. Which are the top-10 countries with more `confirmed` cases?
